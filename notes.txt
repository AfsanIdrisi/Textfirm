Folder Structure
node module
--> Node module folder is a folder consiste of paackages need to create react apps

gitignore
--> use to perform git pull ad push request when the project is hosted in github

paackage.json
--> It contains the name of the paackages that are installed in the node modules

src 
--> It is a folder in which the developer has to define it components and props

index.js
--> Work as entry that trasfers data from app.js to index.html file

App.js
-->It is the file which reflects the changes created by the developer





JSX
--> Jsx is Html content which is return by js function or components created in App.js file
--> We can only return one element from a function like
return(<h1>Afsan</h1>
        <h2>Idrisi</h1>)----False

Instead we can use jsx fragments <>This is jsx fragment</>
return(<>
    <h1>Afsan</h1>
        <h2>Idrisi</h1>
    </>)----True

Use of js in html tags
--> Whenever we need to write a js inside a html tag we have enclose the part to be run as js into {};
example
let name="Afsan";
<h1>Hello {name}</h1>



MJS
--> Use to import data from one file to another 
-->Types of import
1) Default 
2) NO Default

1. Default
Suppose having a file named as module.mjs with 4 variables declared
let a="Afsan"
let b= "Sahil"
let c ="Pushpal"
let d="Nothing"
export default a;
export b;
export c;
now after creating this if write in my app.js file
import name from ./module.mjs // This will import the default value and store it in the name variable;

import {b,c} from ./module.js //This will import b,c in the file but name cant be changed 

Components
--> A line code that developer can import on its main page of the site example Navbar,Footer,Sidebar,etc

React Function Based Components (RFC)
Syntax
import React from 'react'
export default function Navbar(){
    return (
        <>
            The line of Html Codes
        </>
    )
}

Props In React
Props is a object which is passed by an component function link Navbar that can be accessed inside the code of that components 
Example

import React from 'react';

export default function Navbar(props) {
    return (
        <>
            <div id="navbar">
                <li><a href="">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="">About Us</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Contact Us</a></li>
                <li><a href="">Shop</a></li>
            </div>

            <div id="welcomeText">
                <h1>Welcome To Text Analyzer Mr {props.user}</h1>
            </div>
        </>
    )
}

in the above example props is an object which is getting accessed inside the code but user is an attribute of props
which is defined while importing the Nabar Components
Example
<Navbar user="Afsan"/>

PropTypes 
Navbar.defaultProps={
    user:"User"
}

Navbar.propTypes={
    user:PropTypes.string
}
